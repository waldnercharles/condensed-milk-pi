# Changelog

All notable changes to condensed-milk.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Expanded build-output compression for `make`, CMake configure commands,
  and `cmake --build`, including recursive make chatter and CMake percentage
  progress lines. Meaningful compiler output, warnings, errors, and trailing
  build summaries remain visible.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added — backend profiles (Phase 1 of vLLM/Qwen support)

New `profile` system bundles every backend-specific tuning knob into a
named profile that's selected explicitly per session. Anthropic users
get zero behavior change — the `default` profile is identical to v1.9.0.
A new `qwen-vllm` profile bakes in research-derived tunings for Qwen3.x
served via vLLM, where the cache model, long-context behavior, and
placeholder norms differ from Anthropic.

**Built-in profiles:**

| Knob | `default` (Anthropic) | `qwen-vllm` |
|---|---|---|
| `thresholds` | `[0.30, 0.45, 0.60]` | `[0.20, 0.35, 0.55]` |
| `coverage` | `[0.60, 0.80, 0.95]` | `[0.50, 0.75, 0.92]` |
| `effectiveContextCap` | model default | `131072` |
| `placeholderFormat.bash` | `[cm-masked bash] {cmd}` | same |
| `placeholderFormat.read` | `[cm-masked read] {path} ({n} lines, {size})` | same |
| `maskOldThinking` | `off` | `with-coverage` |

Qwen-vllm rationale: vLLM has no Anthropic-style cache_control breakpoint
rescue tier (per [vLLM APC docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/design/prefix_caching/)),
so we trigger compression earlier. Qwen3.6 long-context degrades past
~128K with YaRN scaling, so we cap pressure math at 131072 even when the
model is served at 262144. Qwen3 ships with `preserve_thinking` on so
historical `<think>` blocks accumulate in context — we mask them under
the same coverage gate as tool results (per [JetBrains Dec 2025](https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/12/efficient-context-management/),
masking matched or beat LLM-summary on 4/5 settings on Qwen3-Coder 480B).

**Config (`~/.config/condensed-milk.json`):**

```json
{
  "profile": "qwen-vllm",
  "profiles": {
    "my-custom": {
      "label": "my A/B variant",
      "thresholds": [0.15, 0.30, 0.50],
      "coverage": [0.50, 0.75, 0.95],
      "effectiveContextCap": 131072,
      "placeholderFormat": {
        "bash": "<elided tool=\"bash\" cmd=\"{cmd}\"/>",
        "read": "<elided tool=\"read\" path=\"{path}\" lines=\"{n}\" size=\"{size}\"/>"
      },
      "maskOldThinking": "above-cutoff"
    }
  }
}
```

### Added — historical thinking-block masking

New `maskOldThinking` policy on each profile: `"off"` |
`"with-coverage"` | `"above-cutoff"`. When non-`off`, assistant messages
before the static cutoff have their `<think>...</think>` text spans,
`{type: "thinking"}` content blocks, and top-level `reasoning_content`
fields replaced with deterministic empty strings. Bytes stay
identical turn-over-turn, so prefix cache is preserved.

Default profile keeps `"off"` (no behavior change for Anthropic
users — extended thinking is already cache-controlled by Claude).
`qwen-vllm` profile defaults to `"with-coverage"`.

### Added — `/compress-profile` command

Inspect or switch active profile:

```
/compress-profile                # show active profile + built-ins
/compress-profile qwen-vllm      # switch (takes effect next session)
```

Validates that the requested profile exists (built-in or in user
`profiles` map) before writing. Switch is persisted to
`~/.config/condensed-milk.json` and applied at next `session_start`.

### Changed — `/compress-stats` shows profile

New lines at the top show active profile name + key tunings, plus
any profile-validation warnings. Cache impact section now hints when
`prompt_tokens_details: null` across the whole session may mean the
provider isn't reporting cache hits (vLLM versions before
[vllm#23363](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/23363)
lack this on the OpenAI-compat path — server-side `/metrics` shows the
real hit rate).

### Added — status-bar toggle (from PR #1 by @joelazar)

`showStatus` config flag (default `true`) gates the `↓N (Cf)` token-savings
indicator that's published to the pi footer. Toggle via:

```
/compress-config status on   # show indicator
/compress-config status off  # hide it; compression still runs
```

Orthogonal to compression — only controls the footer display. Persisted
alongside `thresholds`/`coverage`/`profile`. Preserved across profile
reloads at `session_start` so switching profiles doesn't reset the
footer preference.

### Compatibility

- Existing v1.9.x configs (top-level `thresholds` / `coverage`, no
  `profile` field) keep working unchanged. Top-level fields are now
  treated as overrides on top of the active profile when active is
  `"default"` — i.e., the back-compat path.
- Custom profile names that don't appear in `BUILT_IN_PROFILES` start
  from the `default` profile and apply user fields on top.
- Unknown profile names log a warning and fall back to `default` —
  never crashes session start.
- `showStatus` defaults to `true` for users upgrading from any prior
  version — footer appears as before until explicitly hidden.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed — compound-command stdout over-masking (ADR-030)

**Bug.** Multi-segment bash commands whose final segment matched a prefix
filter had their ENTIRE concatenated stdout replaced by the filter's
compressed output. Example:

```
$ cd /repo && git init && git add -A && git status --short | head -10 \
  && echo "..." && git status --short | wc -l
  on unknown: clean
```

`dispatch` matched the last `git status` segment in reverse-order and ran
`filterGitStatus` against the combined output of all six commands. Parsing
fell through to default `v2`, counted nothing, emitted `on unknown: clean`
— hiding init messages, file listings, and the `wc` count the user wanted.

**Fix — two defensive layers:**

1. **Dispatch guard** (`filters/dispatch.ts`). New `SILENT_COMMANDS`
   allowlist (`cd`, `export`, `set`, `unset`, `source`, `.`, `true`,
   `false`, `:`). When the compound has ≥ 2 *non-silent* segments, skip
   all prefix filters and only run content-based fallbacks.

2. **Git-status confident detection** (`filters/git-status.ts`).
   `detectFormat` no longer defaults eagerly. Returns `null` unless it
   observes a v2 header (`# branch.`), a v1 header (`## `), a plain
   header (`On branch `), or ≥ 2 v1-short-format lines (2-char porcelain
   code + space + path). `filterGitStatus` returns `null` on null format.

Preserves legitimate `cd repo && git status` compression (single
non-silent segment). Loses compression on dual-producer chains like
`git add . && git commit -m`, accepted tradeoff.

New regression test: `test-compound-cmd.mjs` (4/4 PASS).

### Changed — self-documenting mask placeholders (ADR-029, issue #2)

**Problem.** Fresh agents parachuted into a session via `context_checkout`
misread `[masked bash] <cmd>` placeholders as tool failures. Reported by
@quantfiction in [issue #2](https://github.com/tomooshi/condensed-milk-pi/issues/2):
a fresh agent switched to `grep`/`read` workarounds (also masked, wasting
turns), then hallucinated a "transient workspace UI rendering issue" to
explain the inconsistency. Only identified the real cause when the user
named the extension.

**Fix — two coordinated changes:**

1. **Placeholder prefix renamed** from `[masked …]` to `[cm-masked …]`:
   - `[cm-masked bash] <command …>`
   - `[cm-masked read] <path> (N lines, SIZE)`

   The `cm-` prefix brands the placeholder as a condensed-milk artifact,
   removing the "hidden / redacted / sandbox-blocked" connotation of bare
   "masked". +3 bytes per placeholder, still byte-identical turn-over-turn.

2. **`before_agent_start` system-prompt explainer.** A constant ~150 byte
   addendum is appended to every turn's system prompt via pi's `before_agent_start`
   event (chained across extensions per `BeforeAgentStartEventResult` contract).
   The explainer tells the agent that `[cm-masked …]` means "re-run / re-read
   to get current content". Amortized across the session: cost scales with
   turns, not mask count. Survives `context_checkout` (pi rebuilds the
   system prompt on resume) and `/pi-vcc` compaction.

**Back-compat.** `isMaskedText()` accepts both `[cm-masked ` (current) and
`[masked ` (legacy) prefixes, so `/compress-stats` counts remain correct
for persisted pre-v1.9.0 session files.

**Cache impact.** One-time KV prefix bust at upgrade boundary (old bytes
→ new bytes on any live session). Steady-state cache stability is identical
to v1.8.1 — both the placeholder and `CM_EXPLAINER` are deterministic
module-level constants.

**Token overhead (typical 50-mask session).** ~185 tokens per turn
(+3 B × 50 placeholders + ~150 B explainer). ~1% of typical turn budget,
negligible vs. mask savings.

**Validation.** Eight-scenario real-session harness (`ug5u` bead) covers:
placeholder format end-to-end, system-prompt visibility, parachute /
`context_checkout`, cache-prefix byte stability (turn-diff), legacy
back-compat on persisted sessions, post-`/pi-vcc` regression check,
multi-extension `systemPrompt` chaining, and re-read telemetry baseline
across 5 real sessions.

Files: `filters/context-compress.ts` (placeholder strings + `isMaskedText`),
`index.ts` (`CM_EXPLAINER` const + handler). No config-schema change,
no new commands.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed — post-`/pi-vcc` compaction masked ALL fresh tool output (ADR-028)

**Bug:** after running `/pi-vcc` to compact a session, fresh bash and Read
tool output in the same session was replaced with placeholder strings
(`[masked bash] <command>`, `[masked read] <path>`) even though the
tools executed correctly. Small-output commands (`wc -l`, `grep -c`, etc.)
appeared unaffected because they fell under the `MIN_MASK_LENGTH = 120`
byte threshold, giving the misleading impression of a content-based
classifier. The actual cause was index-based.

**Root cause:** the static-cutoff algorithm (ADR-018) persists `cutoff`
across turns as an **absolute message index**. `/pi-vcc` compaction
collapses the messages array from e.g. 600 entries to ~20, but pi does
not notify condensed-milk of the collapse, so the frozen cutoff (e.g.
400) remains. Every post-compact message sits at index 0–19, all below
400, so every tool_result meeting the length gate gets masked.

**Fix — two layers:**

1. **Event-driven reset (primary).** Register a `session_compact` event
   handler that resets `persistentCutoff = 0`, `zoneEntered = -1`, and
   clears all re-read trackers and ever-masked sets. The masker starts
   fresh against the new message baseline and re-enters zones
   naturally as the post-compact session grows.

2. **Clamp in `decideCutoff` (defense-in-depth).** Clamp the persisted
   cutoff to the current `messagesLength` on every call. If the
   `session_compact` event is ever missed (e.g. a custom compaction
   path pi adds later), the clamp bounds the damage — the worst case
   degrades to "mask everything up to the current position" rather
   than "mask everything forever across future growth."

**Regression test:** `test-compact-reset.mjs` — 8 cases verifying the
clamp, the explicit reset behavior, and the natural zone re-entry
after reset. Includes a no-regression check confirming the pre-compact
normal path still masks correctly.

**Reported by:** agent session in `ab-buy` repo that hit the bug
immediately after `/pi-vcc` at ~42–44% context usage. Diagnostic
observation that "count-only bash survives" was critical to identifying
the length-gate mechanism separately from the index mechanism.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added — opt-in local telemetry for per-user threshold adaptation (ADR-027)

New optional feature: condensed-milk can log one JSONL line per session to
`~/.config/condensed-milk-sessions.jsonl` on graceful shutdown. The data
feeds an upcoming per-user hierarchical Bayesian horizon predictor
(session-horizon-aware threshold selection, see project notes). The
feature is **opt-in only, never default on, stays on the user's machine**,
and never uploads anywhere.

**Activation (three paths):**

```
/compress-telemetry enable-local-logging    # explicit slash command
export CONDENSED_MILK_TELEMETRY=on          # env var alternative
# or edit ~/.config/condensed-milk.json and add {"telemetry": {"local": true}}
```

The slash command verb `enable-local-logging` is deliberately verbose so
it cannot be triggered by a typo. `/compress-telemetry enable` (short form)
returns a warning explaining the full verb is required.

**What's recorded per session:** session duration, final turn count,
pressure zones entered (turn + ctx% at each), tool-call counts by type,
mask events, unique masks, re-reads, avg placeholder hold, thresholds and
coverage in use, cache hit rate, total tokens by bucket, condensed-milk
version, and sha256-truncated (16-char) hashes of session path + cwd.

**What's NOT recorded:** any message or tool output content, file paths
or tool inputs (only hashes), env vars, API keys, or identity info.

**Subcommands:**

```
/compress-telemetry                        # status + full disclosure
/compress-telemetry enable-local-logging   # explicit opt-in
/compress-telemetry disable                # opt-out
/compress-telemetry export                 # write shareable copy for manual volunteer sharing
```

The `export` subcommand writes a timestamped copy of the JSONL to your
home directory. Users who want to help improve condensed-milk defaults
can review that file and send it to the author manually. No automated
upload path exists, by design.

### Fixed — v1.7.0 default upgrade silently blocked by stale user config (ADR-026)

**Bug:** users who had `~/.config/condensed-milk.json` auto-persisted from
v1.6.x or earlier were stuck on old thresholds `[0.20, 0.35, 0.50] ×
[0.50, 0.75, 0.90]` after upgrading to v1.7.0, because the config loader
prefers user file over built-in defaults. The v1.7.0 behavioral change
never took effect unless the user manually edited or deleted the file.

**Fix:** on config load, if the user's thresholds AND coverage exactly
match any recognized prior-version default tuple, auto-overwrite with
current `DEFAULT_CONFIG` values and print a one-line stderr migration
notice. Any config that does not match a known prior default is treated
as an explicit user customization and preserved untouched.

Known prior defaults currently recognized:

- `v1.6.x`: `[0.20, 0.35, 0.50] × [0.50, 0.75, 0.90]`

Future releases that change defaults should append the prior tuple to
the `STALE_DEFAULTS` list before bumping `DEFAULT_CONFIG`.

**Impact:** every user running v1.7.0 with a pre-existing config file
gets auto-migrated to the new recommended defaults on their next session
start. Explicit user customizations remain untouched.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed — default thresholds delayed (ADR-025)

Bumped default cutoff thresholds and coverage after multi-session sweep:

```
thresholds:  [0.20, 0.35, 0.50]  →  [0.30, 0.45, 0.60]
coverage:    [0.50, 0.75, 0.90]  →  [0.60, 0.80, 0.95]
```

### Why

Sweep across 4 real sessions (455–1205 turns, covering code-work and
research workloads) tested 12 threshold×coverage combinations. Results:

| Session | Turns | Old default | New default | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ols-research | 455 | $116.21 | $115.60 | -0.5% |
| mojo-template-pi-dev | 1205 | $1608.79 | $1597.06 | -0.7% |
| funding-sting (long code session) | 670 | $348.69 | $282.26 | **-19.0%** |
| funding-sting (older) | 668 | $177.40 | $175.67 | -1.0% |

Never worse, sometimes dramatically better. The outlier 19% win is on
long code-work sessions with heavy post-zone-2 traffic — the previous
thresholds crystallized the cutoff too early, leaving a growing tail of
un-masked messages after the session continued past zone 2 entry.
Delayed thresholds wait for larger `ti` values at zone entry → larger
final cutoffs (`floor(ti * coverage)`) → more messages masked deeper in
the session.

### Counterintuitive finding

My original hypothesis for ADR-020 (deferred in Feb) was that EARLIER
triggering (`T.15/.30/.45`) would help — more masking time, more savings.
Data falsified this. `T.15` is strictly *worse* than `T.20` on every
session tested (by 0.02–0.9%). Reason: earlier zones fire at smaller
`ti` values, yielding smaller cutoffs in absolute terms.

### Cache-safety

No regressions. Variant counts stayed flat (or decreased by 1) across
all 4 sessions tested. Static-cutoff invariant holds as designed.

### Override if needed

Short-session workloads or agents that need aggressive early masking
can override via `~/.config/condensed-milk.json`:

```json
{
  "thresholds": [0.20, 0.35, 0.50],
  "coverage":   [0.50, 0.75, 0.90]
}
```

Or via `/compress-config thresholds 0.20,0.35,0.50` at runtime.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed — re-read rate display (>100% confusion)

v1.4.0 telemetry reported `Re-read rate: reads 108.3%` on a long
session. >100% is legal (same path can be re-read multiple times)
but reading it as a percentage is confusing — the row crosses the
"rate" mental model. Changed to a ratio with × notation:

```
  Re-read ratio: reads 1.08× | bashes 0.00× (events per unique mask)
```

Values above 1.0× indicate at least one mask was re-read multiple
times. Cosmetic only — no behavior change. Data in `Unique masks`
and `Re-read events` rows is unchanged.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed — cd-prefix invisibility + cwd-unaware invalidation

The v1.5.x invalidation regexes anchored at `^git`, which meant
`cd /repo && git commit` never matched as an invalidator — a silent
miss in the most common bash idiom the agent uses. Even once stripped,
matching ignored cwd, so multi-repo sessions could see repo A's commit
spuriously invalidate repo B's git status output.

**Fix (parseCdPrefix):** iterative `cd X && cd Y && CMD` parsing. Last
cd wins as effective cwd; residual command is what regex rules match.

**Fix (cwd scoping):** `buildToolCallIndex` records cwd per bash call.
`isCommandInvalidated` compares the candidate's cwd against each later
invalidator's cwd; invalidation fires only on exact match (including
both-undefined for the single-cwd no-cd common case). Cross-cwd
mismatches no longer invalidate — err toward keeping output visible.

### Added — user-configurable rules

Global `~/.pi/agent/condensed-milk-config.json` + project-local
`./condensed-milk.config.json` (merged additively):

```json
{
  "referenceBasenames": ["spec.yaml"],
  "referencePathSubstrings": ["/my-specs/"],
  "invalidationRules": [
    { "invalidator": "^cargo\\s+(build|update)", "invalidated": "^cargo\\s+(check|clippy)" }
  ],
  "disableDefaults": false
}
```

`disableDefaults: true` replaces built-ins instead of extending; any
file setting it wins.

**Fail-loud:** ENOENT is skipped (optional files). Any other read
error or JSON parse error throws — better than silently running with
wrong rules.

### Architecture

Filter module (`filters/context-compress.ts`) stays pure — no fs IO.
All file reads happen in `index.ts` at extension load; resolved rules
are passed into `compressStaleToolResults` via `opts.rules`. Tests
inject rules the same way, no subprocess or fs mocking needed.

### Cache-safety

Sweep on 926-msg session, default T.20/.35/.50 × C.50/.75/.90:
variants 42 → 42, cost unchanged. Parsing is deterministic per
command; cwd scope strictly narrows invalidation (fewer false
positives never more).

### Tests

6 new v1.6.0 assertions in `test-rereads.mjs`:

- `parseCdPrefix` bare, single, chained cds
- cd-prefix invalidation now fires (git add invalidates git status
  with cd prefix)
- cwd scoping blocks cross-repo invalidation
- user-config `referenceBasenames` protect custom paths
- user-config `invalidationRules` fire (cargo build invalidates
  cargo check)
- `disableDefaults` suppresses built-in git rule

### Stacked-diff tool notes

Built-in rules only match `git`. Tools like `gt` (Graphite), `jj`
(Jujutsu), `spr`, `sapling` are NOT invalidators by default — same as
pre-v1.6.0. Users can add custom rules via config, e.g.:

```json
{ "invalidationRules": [
  { "invalidator": "^gt\\s+(up|down|submit|checkout|sync|restack)", "invalidated": "^git\\s+(status|diff|log)" }
]}
```

Cwd-scope protects the common multi-repo case: a `gt submit` in
`/repoA` won't invalidate `git status` in `/repoB`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed — expanded reference-file protection

`REFERENCE_FILES` was exact-basename match only, which missed the most
frequently re-read categories in real sessions:

- Per-project decision records under `knowledge/decisions/`
- Shared vault concepts and patterns
- Agent skill entry points (`SKILL.md`)
- AST rule definitions under `rules/`

**Change:** `isReferenceFile` now checks two sources:

1. **Basename set** (unchanged semantics, expanded list): added `SKILL.md`,
   `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` alongside existing
   `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.
2. **Path substrings** (new): any path containing `/knowledge/decisions/`,
   `/knowledge/concepts/`, `/knowledge/patterns/`, `/.pi/agent/skills/`,
   `/.pi/skills/`, or `/rules/` is treated as reference.

### Why it's cache-safe

Expanding protection only reduces the masked set; it does not change
the placeholder text for any file that still gets masked. Sweep on a
real 926-message session at the default T.20/.35/.50 × C.50/.75/.90
config:

- Variants: 42 → 42 (unchanged)
- Cost: ≈ identical ($116.21)

### Tests

`test-rereads.mjs` gains a reference-path block: seeds reads for
ADR paths, skill files, rule files, and project meta, forces zone 2
(most aggressive masking), and asserts none end up in `maskedPaths`
nor carry a `[masked read]` placeholder.

### Deferred to v1.6.0

JSON config file (`~/.pi/agent/condensed-milk-config.json`) for
user-defined basenames/substrings/globs, and dynamic promotion of
frequently-read paths. Hardcoded list ships now because the common
cases are covered and the config plumbing is larger than the fix.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed — re-read telemetry bugs exposed by real-session data

Real v1.3.0 telemetry (100 turns, 30% context) showed two bugs:

1. `turnsSinceMask` was always 0.0. pi re-feeds the raw (unmasked)
   session history on every context event, so `compressStaleToolResults`
   re-applies masks each turn. v1.3.0 used `Map.set()` unconditionally
   on each re-application — the stored turn overwrote the first-mask
   turn with the current turn.
   **Fix:** only `.set()` the tracker when the key is absent. An item
   is re-set as "fresh first-mask" only after it was consumed by a
   re-read (`.delete()`).

2. Re-read rate underreported by ~100x. v1.3.0 used
   `reReadCount / contextMasksTotal` where the denominator was the
   cumulative re-application count (re-applied ≈ N masks every turn).
   **Fix:** introduced `everMaskedReads: Set<string>` and
   `everMaskedBashes: Set<string>` as denominators. Rate is now split
   per type: reads X.X% | bashes Y.Y%.

3. `contextMasksTotal` similarly overcounted (every turn added all
   under-cutoff items again). **Fix:** increment only on first-time
   additions to the ever-masked sets.

### Changed — read placeholder enriched

v1.3.0 real-session data showed reads had 33% re-read rate (3/9)
while bashes had 0% (0/52) — the read placeholder `[masked read] /path`
was semantically lossy. The command name in `[masked bash] <cmd>` was
sufficient because the command itself signals freshness.

**New read placeholder:** `[masked read] /path (N lines, SIZE)` where
N is the line count and SIZE is the original content size (e.g. `2.4KB`).
Derived purely from the original content → byte-deterministic per
message → cache prefix stays stable. Verified on real JSONLs: variants
count unchanged (42→42, 6→6 on two sessions); $ delta <0.005%.

**Bash placeholder unchanged.**

### Changed — /compress-stats output

```
Re-read Telemetry (v1.4.0)
  Unique masks: R reads, B bashes
  Currently tracked: R reads, B bashes (evicted on re-read)
  Re-read events: K (R reads, B bashes)
  Re-read rate: reads X.X% | bashes Y.Y%
  Avg turns placeholder held: Z.Z
```

ADR-022 (`knowledge/decisions/022-v1-4-0-telemetry-fixes-and-read-placeholder-enrich.md`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — re-read telemetry (instrumentation only, no behavior change)

Tracks whether the model re-reads a file or re-runs a command AFTER
it was masked. A re-read signals the placeholder wasn't sufficient —
masking was semantically lossy for that item.

**Mechanism:**
- When a read/bash tool result is newly masked, the extension records
  `(path | command, turnNumber)` in an in-memory Map.
- On a subsequent `tool_result`, if the same path or command appears,
  increment `reReadCount`, record `turnsSinceMask` delta, evict the
  entry (consumed).

**Surfaced in `/compress-stats`:**
```
Re-read Telemetry (v1.3.0 exp 3)
  Tracked masks: N reads, M bashes
  Re-read events: K (R reads, B bashes)
  Re-read rate: X.X% of masks refetched
  Avg turns since mask: Y.Y
```

**Defaults unchanged** (ADR-020 defers the default-threshold change
from the v1.3.0 exp 1 sweep until this telemetry produces a signal).

**API change:** `CompressResult` now includes `maskedPaths: string[]`
and `maskedCommands: string[]` listing newly-masked items this call.
Callers that only read `.masksApplied` are unaffected.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed — drift bug in v1.2.0 static-cutoff algorithm

v1.2.0 recomputed `targetCutoff = floor(messages.length × coverage[zone])`
every turn. When at zone 2 (>50% context) and messages keep appending,
the cutoff crept forward by ~1 message per new message — effectively a
rolling window at rate 0.9, not a static cutoff.

Observed live: ~6 drift-write events per 275-turn session at zone 2,
each costing ~$0.60 cache write.

### Changed — true-static cutoff

Cutoff now freezes at the moment a zone is first entered and does NOT
re-derive from `messages.length` on subsequent turns. Exactly 3
cache-write events per session (one per zone crossing) instead of
drift-firing every ~10-15 turns.

API addition: `decideCutoff(messagesLength, opts)` returns
`{cutoffIdx, activeZone, zoneAdvanced}`. Caller persists `zoneEntered`
and `cutoffIdx` across turns; filter is pure.

### Measured (same 1114-turn session used to validate v1.2.0)

| Algorithm | Variants | Total cost |
|---|---|---|
| Rolling N=10 (v1.1.1) | 340 | $1789 |
| Static semi (v1.2.0) | 175 | $1545 |
| **True-static (v1.2.1)** | 175 | $1549 |

Cost delta vs v1.2.0 is within noise on multi-zone sessions. The win is
predictability + correctness: the algorithm now behaves as the ADR-018
thesis describes. Single-zone long sessions (typical zone-2 tails) will
save drift writes not visible in the aggregate multi-zone number.

### Migration

Automatic. No config changes. Existing installs picking up v1.2.1 will
transparently use the frozen-on-zone-entry behavior.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed — cache-thrash bug in rolling-window masking (ADR-018)

The rolling-window algorithm introduced in v1.1.0 was measured to be
**actively harmful**: it produced 2x more distinct cache prefix variants
than no masking at all, costing 11% MORE than doing nothing.

Root cause: mask frontier at `messages.length - windowSize` shifts by 1
every turn a new tool result appends. Anything hashed up through BP2
(last-user-message cache breakpoint) that included that position must
be re-cached. Classic frontier-drift thrash.

### Changed — static-cutoff algorithm replaces rolling window

The cutoff T advances only when context usage crosses a pressure
threshold. Between advances, T is immutable — bytes before T stay
byte-identical turn-over-turn — cache prefix stays stable.

- Default thresholds: `[0.20, 0.35, 0.50]` of context window usage
- Default coverage:   `[0.50, 0.75, 0.90]` fraction of messages masked

T monotonically advances. Once a message is masked, it stays masked.

### Measured on a real 1114-turn session JSONL (test-replay.mjs)

| Algorithm | Cache variants | Write cost | Read cost | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No retroactive masking | 157 | $1386 | $28 | **$1414** |
| Rolling window N=10 (v1.1.1) | 316 | $1564 | $30 | **$1594** |
| Static cutoff (v1.2.0) | 159 | $1320 | $26 | **$1346** |

Static cutoff saves **16% vs rolling window** and **5% vs no masking**.

### Config changes

- `windowSize` replaced by `thresholds` + `coverage` arrays
- Old config files with `windowSize` silently ignored, defaults applied
- `/compress-config thresholds 0.20,0.35,0.50`
- `/compress-config coverage   0.50,0.75,0.90`

### Validation

- test-replay.mjs: offline harness that replays any pi session JSONL
  through both algorithms and reports cache-variant counts + cost.
- Proves directionally correct; live A/B should follow.

### Migration

Automatic. Existing `~/.config/condensed-milk.json` with
`{windowSize: 10}` will be silently overwritten with new defaults on
next config save. No user action needed.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- `/compress-stats` output now correctly reports retroactive masking:
  total tool results masked, distinct mask events, bytes freed — instead
  of the stale `Context retroactive: X saved (N compressions)` line
  which conflated per-event counts with per-mask counts.
- Context-retroactive counters (`contextSaved`, `contextMaskEvents`,
  `contextMasksTotal`) now reset on `session_start` along with the
  other per-session state.
- Removed unused `tokensSaved` local variable.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed — retroactive compression switched from summarization to observation masking

The `context`-event compression path now uses **observation masking** with a
fixed rolling window instead of turn-distance summarization. This follows
JetBrains Research (Lindenbauer et al., Dec 2025) empirical finding that
masking outperforms LLM-style summarization on agent sessions, and
Anthropic's endorsement of "tool result clearing" as the safest lightest
form of compaction.

**Algorithm:**
- Fixed rolling window: last N messages (default 10) kept unmasked
- Older bash and read tool results replaced with deterministic placeholders:
  `[masked bash] <command>` and `[masked read] <path>`
- Reference files (AGENTS.md, CONVENTIONS.md, package.json, etc.) never masked
- Command-invalidation rules still honored (git add invalidates git status etc.)

**Why masking over summarization:**
- Byte-identical placeholders → single cache miss per tool-result lifetime,
  then stable forever. Summarization changed bytes every turn → repeated
  cache misses.
- JetBrains empirical: masking matches or beats summarization on solve
  rate, -52% cost on Qwen3-Coder 480B
- Summaries cause trajectory elongation (+13-15% more turns) by smoothing
  over stop-signals
- Simpler code, fewer edge cases, lower per-turn CPU
- Agent can re-fetch via `read` or re-run commands (just-in-time pattern
  per Anthropic)

**Measured on a real 1074-message session that previously produced 0
compressions:** 301 masks applied, ~420KB saved, ~105K tokens freed.

### Removed

- `STALE_THRESHOLD` turn-distance heuristic (replaced by rolling window)
- `buildFileOpsMap` / file-op tracking (masking is self-correcting)
- `cacheAware` config toggle + `cacheTtlMs` — was structurally broken
  (relied on missing `createdAt` field) and unnecessary under masking
- `JSON.stringify(messages).length` savings measurement — replaced with
  analytical sum computed during the pass (MB-per-turn overhead gone)

### Added

- `window-size` config key: `/compress-config window-size <N>`
- `masksApplied` field in per-turn telemetry
- Robust toolCallId → command/path lookup: works on both live in-memory
  context events (where `details` is populated) and persisted JSONL
  shapes (where `details` is dropped)

### Migration

Existing config files with `cacheAware` / `cacheTtlMs` will be silently
ignored and replaced on next save. Default behavior change: compression now
fires on every session with >10 messages. Previously it often produced 0
compressions on post-branch-summary sessions.
